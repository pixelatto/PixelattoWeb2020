Hi, CardCreators!

We are still working hard to improve a lot of the issues we had pending on the backlog. We've also included a new advanced sample project to showcase the features of the latest updates.

Enjoy it !

**New Features**

* Add new MagicalDeck sample project.
* Embebed icons now inherits color alpha from the text.



**Improvements**

* Increased layer visibility list height size.
* Changed default color and outline for new text fields.
* Moved SampleProjects outside.
* Updated some sample projects.



**Bugfixes**

* Fix text alignment rendering.
* Fix justified text rendering.
* Fix embebed icons (variables) rendering.


This update is released in the ***master*** branch. If you want to use an older app version, you can learn [how to change to a beta or legacy branch in steam here](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=/blog/beta-and-legacy-versions).

Currently beta branch has the same last version (2.7.0) as master and the previous stable version (2.6.5) that was in master was moved to a new branch "legacy_2018". The old legacy branch was renamed to "legacy_2017".
