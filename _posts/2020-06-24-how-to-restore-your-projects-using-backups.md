Restoring a backup in Card Creator is a **really simple** process.

Just need to:

**1)** Open the backups folder inside your Card Creator project and choose the backup .zip file you want to restore (those are named by the date and time they were created!)

**2)** Unzip all the files inside the data folder in your Card Creator project (make sure a new backup as been done or make a copy yourself!)

**3)** Enjoy your restored project!
