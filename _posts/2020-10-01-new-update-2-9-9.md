**New Features**

* Add custom PNG icons support (read how to use this feature below).



**Improvements**

* Add thousands of new icons and categories from game-icons.net (2020-02-07).
* Increased scroll width in Icon Picker Dialog.



**Bugfixes**

* \[Internal] Text with outline will now render the text without outline (saving cpu resources) in case that it has reached the maximum 65k vertices limit (try to lower the character count or split the text in more text panels).

\
\
\
In order to use your own custom icons, you need to:

1. Create a folder in:

   \[...]\Steam\steamapps\common\Card Creator\IconGallery\<NEW_FOLDER_NAME>


2. Copy your PNG icons into the new created folder.

\
That's all! They will appear in the Icon Picker Dialog in his own category.\
\
**Note**: We recommend to use *transparent PNG* images with *white pixels* (so the app can tint their colors like the others).\
