Learn how the backups system works and how to restore them

Restoring a backup in Card Creator is a **really simple** process.

Just need to:

1. Open the backups folder inside your Card Creator project and choose the backup .zip file you want to restore (those are named by the date and time they were created!)
2. Unzip all the files inside the data folder in your Card Creator project (make sure a new backup as been done or make a copy yourself!)
3. Enjoy your restored project
