Learn how to create card formats for your cards using the Blueprint tools

- - -

# Blueprint mode

In order to create your cards, first you need to create blueprints for those cards.

When you create a new card set, a prompt will allow you to create a new blueprint or use an existent one.

You can also edit an existing one by going to the blueprint preview image in the cardset:

Once you are in blueprint mode, you can rename it by clicking on it's name in the top bar.

## Card

First, set your card dimensions (you can change it again later). The card dimension tool will appear **on mouse hover**:

## Layers

A blueprint is composed by layers stacked on top of each other like a sandwich ðŸ¥ª

You can add, remove, rename and sort layers using the toolbar at the right. Switch the sides of the card with the "Front/Back" button at the bottom.

You can also set the margin of the layer with respect to the edge of the card, and the spacing between panels per layer.

## Panels

Select the layer you want to edit. Then you can manage your panels:

* Add a new one by splitting an existing panel.
* Resize by moving the separator between two panels.
* Delete by right-click the separator between two panels.

There are 4 types of panels:

* Code (to generate different matrix barcodes like QR)

Each panel type have different data that can be customized.
