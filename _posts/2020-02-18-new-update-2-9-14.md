**Bugfixes**

* Fix panel offset rendering issue when merging panels in blueprint mode.


**Important**: If your card panels were misaligned or incomplete (ex: you only see half of a panel, etc) or, in other words, different from what you see in blueprint mode, this update should fix it.\
***You need to open the project and enter in edit blueprint mode for each blueprint your project contains***.

That's all, when you return to the card collection screen from the blueprint mode your cards now will render as in the blueprint mode.
