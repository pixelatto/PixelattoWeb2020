**Improvements**

* Once one card is loaded, it'll show up again blazingly fast thanks to a new caching system.
* Cards now load twice as fast.
* Increased texture cache size to 2GB.



**Bugfixes**

* Fix image filter when loading embeded images or images bigger than 2K resolution.
* Update locked panels on all sample projects.
* Fix TresDeck wrong image paths.

\
\
**Important**: If you had a embeded image with a line of corrupted pixels on top of the image, you will need to delete that embeded image and load it again manually.\
