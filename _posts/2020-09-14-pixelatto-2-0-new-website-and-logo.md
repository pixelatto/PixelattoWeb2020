# We've made some changes to our website (and our logo)!

**Pixelatto** has changed a lot since it was founded back in 2014. Our team grew up from being only a one person to six people, we have released *AutoTileGen, Reventure, Card Creator.*..and we have a lot of new projects in our timeline! Due to all that, we gave our image the **change that was very much needed.**

We wanted our **logo** to look more friendly, and to show our two biggest goals as a company:\
**Videogames and software development**.

 Additionally, we added some orange to the logo. Check it out!

On the other hand, our **website** has changed in order to be able to **contain a lot of new stuff**! 

We will be posting here info about all our new projects, guides for the existing ones, and tons of content. 

Stay tuned!
