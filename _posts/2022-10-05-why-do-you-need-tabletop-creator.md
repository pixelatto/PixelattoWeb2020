## Some interesting features

You would need to know lots of things to do it right. You need to know how to create the game, how to edit graphics, how to create text and many other things. And if you want to do it on your own, you may think it is crazy.

Many people used to do it by hand, years ago: drawing it, cutting all items and doing modifications themselves. Later, graphic design tools like Photoshop was useful for that but it was not good enough. It takes too much time to do changes to your cards. However, that will not be a problem anymore with **[Tabletop creator](https://pixelatto.com/store/tabletop-creator/)**.
