This update is released in the ***master*** branch. If you want to use an older app version, you can learn [how to change to a beta or legacy branch in steam here](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1129108624).\
\
\
Currently beta branch has the same last version (2.7.0) as master and the previous stable version (2.6.5) that was in master was moved to a new branch "legacy_2018". The old legacy branch was renamed to "legacy_2017".
