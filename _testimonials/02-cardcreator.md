                Don't mind the early reviews, this software has come a long way. The developers are super helpful, willing to answer questions, and they are constantly improving and polishing this app. Direct, fluid integration with both Tabletop Simulator and Tabletop Playground.

                A great card creator that really helps get the creative juices flowing with a simple and intuitive interface.
                
                Waaaaaaaaay easier than grinding your soul down to nothing using Photoshop trying to do the same thing.

                This tool is awesome. I've tried other tools and this one has me making cards very quickly. I'm a newbie at Photoshop so take that for what it's worth.

                The developers are very responsive and active on this product. They've made tremendous changes and fixes since I bought version 1.0.

                It doesn't have importing from spreadsheets yet but they are working on it. I definitely recommend this app. I also hardly write reviews but the progress and ease of use has me wanting to pass this along, especially after looking for something like this for a long time.

                CardCreatorのレビューSteamにとりあえず書いたよ。
                「個人宅やシート単位で印刷する」のに特化してるソフトなので、ボードゲーム制作者はみんな買え！ってほどじゃないけど、カードの枚数も管理できるのは（同じカードを複数枚印刷したりしなかったりするゲームには）便利だよ。
